# What is this project about?
This is an emulator that simulates the Intel-8080 processor, enabling programs written for the Intel 8080 to run on non-native hardware.
The main goal of this project is to be able to run the original Space Invaders on this emulator.

## Limitations for now

- The AC (Auxillary Carry) flag has not been implemented. This might cause issues with certain instructions, but is not required for Space Invaders
