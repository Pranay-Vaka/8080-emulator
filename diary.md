## Thoughts
After looking back at the code, I realised that it sucks. This is because of all the inconsistencies
in the functions, how the pc is incremented and the difference between addresses and data and stuff.

I will go back, write all the problems, probably raise issues and then refactor the code so that it
does not completely suck.
